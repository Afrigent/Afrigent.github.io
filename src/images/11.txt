I made money in paper trading but always had that fear with real money, so I
decided to go deeper in concepts of technical analysis, after spending some
months, I developed a perception, a different way of looking at things...

For people they were lines, charts, shapes, but for me they were emotions, Soon I
started to make money in the real market too, Finally, I got certifications from
NISM and NCFM, India. Authored 5+ International Best Selling Training
Programs, Trained More than 12K Students and Realized that It was nothing
wrong with me ever, Knowledge and Perception were the Key Factors in
changing this game, and that was the main reason for creating Trading Mindset,
to help people who are in exact same spot where I was, to help them to succeed

through Stock Market! â€œ
