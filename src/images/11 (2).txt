NO Itâ€™s Not Like That!!!

Having a Stop Loss Level means that I am accepting the loss probability to a
certain extent, I have determined my position and I have taken control over my
fear of facing a loss in trade by implementing a Stop Loss...

I have a Practical Assessment Here For You...

Login to your TradingView account

Open any chart of your choice

Use Paper Trading Mode

Select 5-Minute Time Frame

Use EMA 5 and EMA 10 and EMA 20

Add Bollinger Band to see Direction of Trade
Trade Bullish or Bearish Crossover Accordingly

You have to take 20 trades but take next trade only when previous is over
Keep Stop Loss at EMA 20 and Profit at Reverse Crossover of 5 and 10.

Control Your Fear and See What Happens?

What was your brain focusing on.... If you were focussing only on Looses then
you would have ended up with a Negative Balance!
