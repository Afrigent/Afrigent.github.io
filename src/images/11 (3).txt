If you were focusing on controlling your Fear and not on trade results, then there
are 60% Chances that you have a Positive Balance in the end...

Itâ€™s not about Trade Balance at this time, You only used EMA Crossover to
trades which is not what you have learnt in my Training Courses!

You can easily combine other things like Divergence, Momentum, VWap, etc. to
get better results, But to reach that level, you first need to control your fear.

If you were able to close your trades on Signals I gave above then you did
Marvellous and congratulations on this big achievement!
