Chapter 2: Self Analysis!

Now That You Know Your Story...

It’s time to analyse some stuff, before investing even a single penny, you should
know your exact position in numbers.

You need to analyse stuff like are you in a position to lose some money, if yes

then till what extend, what is your income source apart from stock market, and
what are you liabilities at the moment, in near future & in long term, even your
age matters, are you just in 20’s, 30-40 or near to your retirement period...

EVERYTHING COUNTS!

When you know everything about yourself, you can easily understand your own
emotions...

Remember that Stock Market is all about Emotions, and until you know how to
control and manage your own emotions, how will you trade of other’s...!

So to make the work easy, I will give you some Questions and you have to write
their answers, BE HONEST, because it’s all about you!
